# katzrdum for Google Glass
Software to manage publishing and configuring open source software designed for Google Glass.
This project is still at the concept stage and may evaporate into vapourware, but let's hope not!

Under construction: [KATZRDUM](https://mine.balrog.cat)

## Apps
All code will be released on GitHub and licensed to allow commercial derivative works except where existing licenses make this impractical (eg COVID check-ins uwill need to use sensitive government APIs and RetroArch is GPL)

Once repositories are available for projects compatible with katzdum, this section will link to them.

* [x] COVID QR code check-in for Victoria
* [ ] Basic minimap
* [ ] Snake game similar to Nokia phones
* [ ] YouTube player for music and videos, hopefully integrate with user's Google account for playlists
* [ ] Emulator forked from [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch)
* [ ] Facial emotional recognition to assist people with autism spectrum disorders, 
[shown to be helpful](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/08/google-glass-helps-kids-with-autism-read-facial-expressions.html)
* [ ] Notetaking
* [ ] Trivia based on opentdb
* [ ] Expanded COVID check-in app for other regions
* [ ] Expanded map application with search and directions
* [ ] VNC viewer

## Example configurations
* COVID QR code check-in app requires a name and a phone number; 
Can be done with voice recognition, but better to type name to get spelling correct
* Emulator needs a means of transferring game backup ROM files onto the Google Glass v2 unit

## Choice of name
My pet cat is named Balrog, after the type of demon encountered in Moria in Lord of the Rings. The dwarvish name for this is Khazad-d√ªm
which I thought sounded a bit like "cats are dumb", and katzrdum is different enough to avoid copyright infringement. 
I also already own the domain [balrog.cat](http://balrog.cat) so that makes a convenient domain to host this on.
A [previous project I made as a gift for my cat](https://github.com/mensly/Dwarrowdelf) was also named after this same place.

## License
Do what you want with this code, but if you find it useful or learn something, buy me a pint sometime :)
